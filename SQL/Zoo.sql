1) A new animal has come in, with the following details:
name - "Slim", type - "Giraffe", country_id - 1
Add him to the Animals table.
2) You want to make a complete list of the animals for the zooâ€™s visitors. Write a query to output a new table with each animal's name, type and country fields, sorted by countries.

SELECT a.name,a.type,c.country

ORDER BY c.country;
